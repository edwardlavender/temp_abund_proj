## Introduction 

This repository contains methods, written in `R`, for Lavender, Fox and Burrows (in review). Modelling the impacts of climate change on the abundance of shallow-water marine fish at a global scale. 

In this work, we developed an approach based on species thermal niches to project changes in the relative abundance of more than 2,000 shallow-water marine fish species under future temperature change scenarios.

## Structure 

1. `data-raw` contains raw data for the project.
    * `spatial` contains spatial information.
        * `ne_110m_coastline` contains world coastline data from [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-physical-vectors/). 
    * `sdm_aquamaps` contains raw [Aquamaps](https://www.aquamaps.org) species distribution model (SDM) predictions (maps) for modelled species, obtained via `get_sdm_aquamaps.R` (see below); 
    * `temperature` contains sea surface temperature (SST) and sea bottom temperature (SBT) global scale CMIP5 ensemble average projections for (a) historical (1956-2005) (b) mid-century (2006-2055) and (c) late-century (2050-2099) time scales under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. All projections were obtained from [NOAA's Climate Change Web Portal](https://psl.noaa.gov/ipcc/ocn/). For SST, for the historical scenario, the [HADISST](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/) dataset is also included for comparison to modelled scenarios.  
    <br />

2. `data` contains processed data. 
    * `spptraits.rds` defines modelled species. 
    * `spatial` contains processed spatial data. 
      * `coastline` contains world coastline data generated by `process_coastline.R`. 
        * `eez` contains exclusive economic zone boundary data from the [Flanders Marine Institute](https://www.marineregions.org/eez.php) and datasets defining the number of modelled cells and species in each EEZ, generated by `process_eez.R` and `analyse_abund_across_eezs.R`. 
        * `map_species_richness.asc` is a raster of the number of modelled species, generated by `analyse_spptraits.R`. 
        * `sdm_aquamaps` contains processed [Aquamaps](https://www.aquamaps.org) SDMs for modelled species, generated by `process_aquamaps.R`. 
    * `temperature` contains processed SST and SBT temperature projections for the time periods and scenarios described above, generated by `process_temp.R`. 
    * `sensitivity` contains processed 'sensitivity' rasters for modelled species, generated by `process_sensitivity.R`.
    * `abundance` contains abundance predictions for SST and SBT for all temperature scenarios, generated by `project_abund.R` and `process_abund.R`.  
    <br />
    
3. `R` contains scripts for data processing, projections and analysis.
    * `get_*` scripts get raw data, where necessary.  
    * `process_*` scripts implement data processing.
    * `project_*` scripts implement relative abundance projections. 
    * `analyse_*` scripts analyse the data and projections, including figure creation.  
    * `helper_*` scripts contain helper functions used in multiple scripts.  
    <br />
  
4. `fig` contains figures. 

Note that the `data-raw`, `data` and `fig` directories are not provided in the online version of this repository.  

## Workflow 

### Data acquisition via `get_*`

1. `get_sdm_aquamaps.R` gets [Aquamaps](https://www.aquamaps.org) SDMs for modelled species, via the [`aquamapsdata`](https://github.com/raquamaps/aquamapsdata) `R` package. 

2. Other raw data are acquired manually (see the links above). 

### Data processing via `process_*` 

1. `process_coastline.R` processes the raw coastline data: 
    * Forces an extent of {-180, 180, -90, 90} to match species' distributions and temperature projections;  
    <br />
    
2. `process_spptraits.R` defines a list of modelled species:
    * Focuses on the subset of species with depth ranges found on [FishBase](http://www.fishbase.org/search.php);
    * Checks for synonyms;
    * Saves a temporary (reduced) list of species for which [Aquamaps](https://www.aquamaps.org) SDMs are acquired and then processed (see `get_sdm_aquamaps.R` and `process_sdm_aquamaps.R`);
    * Using processed species' distributions:
        * Checks SDMs;
        * Gets thermal niche parameters from processed temperature projections;
        * Gets the full taxonomic breakdown;  
    <br />
    
3. `process_sdm_aquamaps.R` processes [Aquamaps](https://www.aquamaps.org) species' distributions:
    * Forces an extent of {-180, 180, -90, 90} to match temperature projections;  
    * Replaces 0 for predicted occurrence with NA;
    * Masks land using processed coastline;  
    <br />
    
4. `process_temp.R` processes temperature projections:
    * Extracts SST and SBT temperature projections from raw files; 
    * Forces an extent of {-180, 180, -90, 90} to match species' distributions;
    * Re-samples temperatures to the same spatial resolution as species' distributions;
    * Masks land using processed coastline to match species' distributions;  
    <br />
    
5. `process_eez.R` processes EEZ data:
    * Gets EEZ areas (in units of modelled grid cells); 
    * Gets EEZ latitudinal mid-points;  
    <br />
    
6. `process_sensitivity.R` derives species' sensitivity indices given thermal niche parameters derived from (a) SST or (b) SBT. This includes: 
    * Mean thermal niche width (species thermal range: STR) over space;
    * Mean thermal bias (species thermal index (STI) - baseline temperatures) over space;
    * Variability in thermal bias over space;

### Projections via `project_*()`

1. `project_abund_1.R` projects changes in species' relative abundance under future climate change scenarios. 
2. `project_abund_2.R` synthesises predictions across species. 

### Analyses via `analyse_*()` 

1. `analyse_spptraits.R` analyses modelled species, including:
    * taxonomic breakdown;
    * depth ranges;
    * distribution; 
    * commercial importance;

2. `analyse_example_thermal_niche.R` analyses an example thermal niche. 
    
3. `analyse_temp.R` analyses SST and SBT temperature projections, for all scenarios. 

4. `analyse_sensitivity.R` analyses species' sensitivity indices. 

5. `analyse_abund_across_globe.R` analyses relative abundance projections across the globe. 

6. `analyse_abund_across_eezs.R` analyses relative abundance projections across EEZs. 

7. `analyse_scenarios.R` analyses the relative severity of projections under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.
